# crypto-bois
Hello, this project is done in Python while making use of the pyDes package which uses encryption algorithms for 3DES (Tripple DES).
This project is done to test wheter encryption & decryption using 3DES works. 
So the user enters the message and the recipients information ( email and phone number ) where the message is encrypted and sent 
to the recipients email and the private key is sent to the recipients phone. The recipient will then input the private key
and the encryted message in the decryption window.
